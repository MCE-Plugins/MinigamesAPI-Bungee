MinigamesAPI-Bungee
===================

DEPRECATED. Starting with version 1.14.9 this plugin is not longer needed. Support for MGLib signs
is merged into the main MinigamesAPI-Plugin.

This needs to be installed on the lobby server to allow setting signs in the lobby which will then be updated by the MinigamesAPI. Later it might support Arcade too.


Sign format for now:
- [0] "MGLib"
- [1] Minigame (e.g. MGSplegg)
- [2] Arena (e.g. test)
- [3] Server (e.g. minigames1)
